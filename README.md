# Rubik's Cube Validator

## Goal

We want to use computer vision techniques to extract information from a photo
of a Rubik's Cube and store the information so that it can potentially be used
for a Rubik's Cube solver. (This project will not solve Rubik's Cubes.)

## Dependencies

We used the Python 2.7 version of Anaconda 4.2.0, available from [Continuum](https://www.continuum.io).

After setup install [`opencv3`](https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv3) and, [`imutils`](https://anaconda.org/stsci/imutils).

## Running

Run the Anaconda Python executable on `color_detect.py`
