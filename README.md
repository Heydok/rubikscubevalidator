# Rubik's Cube Validator

## Goal

We want to use computer vision techniques to extract information from a photo
of a Rubik's Cube and store the information so that it can potentially be used
for a Rubik's Cube solver. (This project will not solve Rubik's Cubes.)

## Dependencies

`Python 2.7.12+` and the `python-opencv` package from Debian/Ubuntu repos or your distribution's equivalent.
